## Description

- I have been tasked to refactor the existing code with the intention of improving it without changing the output, also to improve its accessibility.

## Acceptance Criteria

- I have added semantic elements including 'header', 'nav, 'section', 'aside'

- I have improved the structure of the header and attempted to improve the main section

- I have added 'alt' attributes to all 'img' elements

- The heading attributes fall in sequential order

- I have added company name and 'Search Engine Optimization' to the title element
