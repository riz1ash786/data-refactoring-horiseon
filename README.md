# Horiseon Refactoring

## Description

- As a marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
  Refactoring existing code to improve it without changing the output and improve its accessibility.

## Acceptance Criteria

**I have added semantic elements includind 'header', ''nav, 'section', 'aside'**

_GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards WHEN I view the source code THEN I find semantic HTML elements WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements_

**I have improved the sturcture of the header and attempeted to improve the main section**

_THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning_

**I have added alt attributes to all img elements**

_WHEN I view the icon and image elements THEN I find accessible alt attributes_

**heading atrtributes fall in sequential order**

_WHEN I view the heading attributes THEN they fall in sequential order_
